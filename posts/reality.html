    <h1 style="width: 100%; text-align: center;">The Reality of Education System !</h1>
    <p>India produces more Engineers than the total population of Switzerland.</p>
    <p>Even after that, Switzerland is number one in research and innovation.</p>
    <p>Since Independence, the Republic of India has produced 0 Nobel laureates in science</p>
    <p>The USA has achieved a hundred plus.</p>
    <p>According to the ASER report, 83% of educated Indians is not employable.</p>
    <p>And when we talk about Sundar Pichai and Satya Nadella,</p>
    <p>they have also completed their education from outside of India.</p>
    <p>To find the root cause of what I am saying, we have to go a little back.</p>
    <p>When the Britishers were ruling in India.</p>
    <p>there were two major challenges for the East India Company,</p>
    <p>the first was communication with Indians,</p>
    <p>Second, they required workers and clerk</p>
    <p>Then Thomas Babington Macaulay gave the English Education Act of 1835.</p>
    <p>Due to which both their purposes were fulfilled.</p>
    <p>First, they wanted people who sit quietly at their desks and do their work,</p>
    <p>Who don't ask any questions and they should not be too creative also.</p>
    <p>Second Communication in English</p>
    <p>English is not the most spoken language yet</p>
    <p>English has become a class instead of a language in India.</p>
    <p>Russia, China, France</p>
    <p>All these places do not have as much obsession with English as it is in India.</p>
    <p>If your English is not good then it is called poor communication.</p>
    <p>Rather, not knowing English means you know some other language.</p>
    <p>5 years old IOS is also considered outdated in today's date.</p>
    <p>But such an important thing, our education system is still running in the same way</p>
    <p>even today with a few changes.</p>
    <p>There is a competition of rote learning in our education system,</p>
    <p>The one who uses Rote Learning Technique get more marks</p>
    <p>Now who got 95% in Sanskrit, even he is not able to speak Sanskrit.</p>
    <p>And instead of having a basic history,</p>
    <p>we have such thick books of history which have no meaning.</p>
    <p>Now If you want to know anything</p>
    <p>then you will find out from Google that you do not need to memorize so much.</p>
    <p>And in a government school, English is a subject in every class,</p>
    <p>even after 12 years of studying English, people are not able to speak English</p>
    <p>and a 5-year-old boy learns English without reading any book</p>
    <p>because he gets that environment.</p>
    <p>( a + b )^2 = a^2 + b^2 + 2ab No one knows what is its use in real life,</p>
    <p>neither the teacher nor the principal nor students.</p>
    <p>Maybe it means something, but no one knows its meaning.</p>
    <p>Yes, but instead of 2ab, if you say 3ab, then you will surely see 4 people laughing at you.</p>
    <p>The techniques used in Kinder Gardens to teach children is million times better</p>
    <p>then the rote learning techniques of college.</p>
    <p>And the children who always get good numbers,</p>
    <p>who write in the exams by hiding,</p>
    <p>you will see that when they enter real life, most of them crumble.</p>
    <p>Everyone is taught the same syllabus and the same thing, without looking at their capabilities.</p>
    <p>And creativity doesn't have any importance.</p>
    <p>If You keep lions, fish, snakes, elephants all in one line and tell them to climb up the tree.</p>
    <p>They will feel for the rest of their life's that they are not capable of anything.</p>
    <p>Dronacharya also taught different things to the Pandavas according to their skill set,</p>
    <p>He didn't teach everyone the same thing.</p>
    <p>And we don't have many options in our education system.</p>
    <p>Science is at the top, then commerce and art at the bottom.</p>
    <p>People take Art stream so lightly as if it is of no use,</p>
    <p>every parent want their children to become an engineer or a doctor,</p>
    <p>if the college provides extra courses</p>
    <p>then the parents will not allow to choose them</p>
    <p>So all that college money will be wasted.</p>
    <p>Now, from where the option will come</p>
    <p>Your training starts from childhood itself.</p>
    <p>Parents, brothers and sisters relatives, everyone explains this</p>
    <p>that if you didn't get good marks and a good job,</p>
    <p>then your life is useless</p>
    <p>then you keep your life creativity in the side and</p>
    <p>it becomes your dream to get good marks and a good job.</p>
    <p>Now if this dream of yours comes true then it is great.</p>
    <p>You will make other people feel jealous, you will make others feel low.</p>
    <p>And at this young age, if your dream is broken then you will be in self-doubt</p>
    <p>Outsiders will not consider you that insufficient as you fall in your own eyes.</p>
    <p>Think of any four or five successful people whom you consider very successful</p>
    <p>or the people you want to live your lifelike.</p>
    <p>I can say that they have not been successful because of this education system,</p>
    <p>whoever they are</p>
    <p>Dhirubhai Ambani, Virat Kohli, Aamir Khan, Narendra Modi</p>
    <p>All these people did not fall into the trap of our current education system,</p>
    <p>They learned by themselves, educated themselves and moved ahead.</p>
    <p>If the CEO of a company is asked to give interviews</p>
    <p>in all the departments of his company,</p>
    <p>then there is no guarantee that he will be able to pass the interviews of all the departments</p>
    <p>and it may also happen that he may not qualify</p>
    <p>for more than half the department education-wise</p>
    <p>But he can run the whole company, so why we don't talk about this skill.</p>
    <p>People spend more than 25% of their life in this current education system</p>
    <p>so that they can go and fulfil the dreams of the companies owner</p>
    <p>who are less educated than them</p>
    <p>If Indias Current Education System is that much good,</p>
    <p>then why these celebrity and politicians are sending their children out for studies.</p>
    <p>It should be compulsory for politicians that their children should study in</p>
    <p>The government college of the area from which they win the election.</p>
    <p>Only then the government colleges can improve.</p>
    <p>For 368 peon job 1.5 Lakh Graduates</p>
    <p>and 24,968 Post Graduates Applied for it.</p>
    <p>I will not talk about IAS, PCS because this is a matter of passion.</p>
    <p>But some people are preparing for 5 to 6 years</p>
    <p>So that they can get any government job.</p>
    <p>Ask them why you are preparing for a government job for such a long time,</p>
    <p>then they all will say the same one thing and that is job security.</p>
    <p>Means you won't be fired even if you don't work.</p>
    <p>All this is truancy</p>
    <p>All this comes to our mind because our current education system does not give enough confidence</p>
    <p>So that we can work by our skills power and we don't have to be afraid of being fired.</p>
    <p>I am not talking about the next 10 years but if I talk about the next 5 years</p>
    <p>Then the technology will change so much that what we are studying today.</p>
    <p>the skill we are focusing on.</p>
    <p>Don't know whether that will be relevant or not at that time.</p>
    <p>Cloud computing, SEO, digital marketing</p>
    <p>All these jobs did not exist earlier</p>
    <p>We should be agile, we have to be open to learning new things,</p>
    <p>we should have a creative mind.</p>
